Plan A

1. take cog.yaml from AudioSR
2. add installation steps for audioldm-training-finetuning setup
3. remove packages that are only needed for cog deployment 
4. build image from it


Plan B

1. take cog.yaml from AudioSR and build image from it
2. export dockerfile of that image via cog debug
3. add installation steps for audioldm-training-finetuning setup
4. build another image from it

5. add steps for downloading datasets and checkpoints from google drive

7. Try to train a smaller model 
8. Make it work on windows

acquire compute resources from afeka, requirements:
